Entry #1 Added Wednesday July 1st, 2015
A Small Project for UCI Upper Devision Computer Science Class, Programming Language.

This is an interpreter that translates programs written in SIMPLESEM into computational actions, effectively running the program being interpreted. Code Analysis is the first phase in Interpretation, which ensures the source program is syntactically & semantically correct.
This assignment requires me to implement the syntactic analysis phase of Interpretation; This interpreterâ€™s computational engine is used in a future assignment. (Reference Needed)
